To be honest, I was blown away by the features and ease of implementing those.

The traditional 'try catch' was too complicated and cumbersome to set up, for example in C++, for a 'correct' implementation, you would create Exception Classes and use them to discern the various type of exceptions that could occur, and this method would have a ton of boilerplate code."

For example, I used the crypto standard library that provided me with easy, low-level implementations of most cryptographic techniques and Hashing Technologies. <br /><br /> Using Golang for Database Operations also gave me plenty of opportunities to use Golang's Structs and their features, and also convert them easily to JSON to use in MongoDB. <br /><br /> FootballAPI was also where i learnt to use complex features of MongoDB like sorting and limiting data, in query, instead of doing it in my code."

I also used React as a UI Framework, since it allowed me to create my full application relying on a single language. <br /><br /> Although using Javascript had its features, it also had downsides, first of all, Javascript and/or Express is slow, not majorly slow, but nonetheless slow. Also, the javascript concurrency and promise features are too complex for what they do, only after dabbling in real server-side languages such as Go and Rust have I come to realize, Javascript is not at par with them in this aspect."

It was also different because there were times when I had to rely on other people’s work before I could code my own. <br /> <br /> Although there were downsides to this approach, them being more time-consuming, highly 3rd person-reliant atmosphere, etc. The Advantages far outweighed the disadvantages, I don't think I could have provided such a good project if I did not have the help and insight of my friends."

Still, From a bigger perspective(a group) you can realize that using these strategies are helpful. <br /><br />If i look from a code perspective, this also taught me the power of well split up code, project structure and documentation, because it makes PR's easier to merge and also makes it easier for others to change and understand your code."
